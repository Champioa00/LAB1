Player A,"A dual-threat quarterback with two years of starting experience at the college level, Willis is a dynamic playmaker with both his arm and legs. At 6’1″, he won’t be the tallest quarterback in the class, but the NFL shouldn’t hold that against him. At 215 pounds, he has an excellent build to hold up to the elevated physical rigors at the next level. That allows Willis to play the game with impressive toughness. That presents itself in multiple ways. He can hang tough in the pocket and take a hit. Furthermore, Willis demonstrates grit as a ball carrier when escaping the pocket. He is challenging to take down in the open field due to his toughness and athletic ability. Willis possesses exceptional athletic qualities. The Liberty QB is fast, owns an excellent short-area burst, and his change of direction is phenomenal. This allows him to be an entertaining, electric, and effective dual-threat quarterback. Willis is elusive both in and out of the pocket, shows stellar vision as a runner, and is brilliantly creative. He’s comfortably the most dangerous quarterback in terms of mobility in this 2022 NFL Draft class. Willis also possesses the most impressive arm in this draft class. Where most people have an arm, the Liberty quarterback has a laser-guided missile launcher, a cannon, insert your own metaphor here. He’s capable of launching the ball downfield with relative ease, routinely making throws that leave you flabbergasted. However, arm talent is more than simply being able to heave the ball 60+ yards. Here, Willis exudes elite capability. He creates impressive velocity with minimal effort. Need a 30-plus-yard strike into a tight window? Willis is your man. He puts excellent zip on the ball and can throw from multiple arm angles. The Liberty QB combines his excellent athleticism with the ability to throw a beautiful ball on the run, making him extremely dangerous out of the pocket. In addition to his physical tools, Willis is an on-field leader who attempts to elevate those around him. Off-field, he composes himself well in interview situations and appears to possess high character. His combination of arm talent, elite athleticism, and leadership should make him an alluring prospect in a murky quarterback class. Although the areas for improvement we’re about to talk about might limit his bid to be the QB1 of the class, it wouldn’t be a surprise to find a team fall in love with him at the Senior Bowl and take a leap of faith. For success at the next level, environment will be everything. If Willis lands with a team that accentuates his upside while showing patience to develop him, he can eventually be an excellent playmaker in the NFL. Strong arm, great legs — can’t lose, right? Well, not quite. As entertaining and talented as Willis is, he presents a difficult NFL Draft evaluation for a number of reasons. His scouting report reveals several areas for development, and in some areas, he appeared to regress rather than develop during the 2021 college football season.  Like multiple quarterbacks in the 2022 NFL Draft class, Willis is a work in progress from a decision-making standpoint. He needs to learn when to take the easy option as a passer. He’s guilty of frequently trying to take the difficult option, maybe as a result of arm-arrogance. He’ll try and thread the ball into receivers when they genuinely aren’t open. It’s an issue compounded by an inability to quickly scan the field. This decision-making development also extends to pocket management. While it’s worth pointing out that the Liberty offensive line was dreadful this season, Willis is prone to flee a clean pocket to make a play with his legs rather than work through passing options. He needs to be mindful of stepping up in the pocket rather than working backward in it where he puts himself at risk of giving up significant yardage at the next level. Another area of regression this season was with accuracy. Again, the statistical element of accuracy analysis is hindered by an uninspiring WR group. However, film study shows that Willis is guilty of being high and wide more regularly than you’d like to see from a leading prospect. The Liberty QB needs to improve his accuracy even on simpler, shorter throws."
Player B,Pickett is an accurate passer with nice size. He was on fire in 2021. He has put himself into top-10 consideration.
Player C,"Aidan Hutchinson has excellent potential, but we didn't get to see it very much last year because he suffered an ankle injury."
Player D,"David Ojabo needs to get stronger for the NFL, but he's a terrific pass rusher."
Player E,"Evan Neal is a 360-pound lineman who can move very well, which almost seems impossible."
Player F,"Malik Willis has a huge arm and great mobility, but struggles to process information and see the field very well. Still, he could rise throughout the draft process and enter top-10 consideration"
Player G,"The Giants have an excellent secondary, but they're still not great against the pass because they don't have a quality pass rush"
Player H,"Sam Howell threw for 38 touchdowns in 2019, which was a Division I-A record for a freshman. He doesn't have ideal size (6-1, 225), but there's no doubting his throwing ability"
Player I,Jordan Davis was a monster in the 2021 season debut against Clemson. He has continued to dominate this year
Player J,"Derek Stingley had a freshman campaign for the ages, completely erasing one side of the field despite having no experience entering the year. He has great size (6-1, 190) and projects as a top-five prospect whenever he declares"
